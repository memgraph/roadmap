## Release Cycle ♻️

Memgraph product team works in 6-week release cycles. Every six weeks, a new release of Memgraph includes all finished features and resolved bug reports. The exact release dates are visible as Due Dates under [milestones](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/milestones). There might be bug-fix releases between regular releases, depending on how critical these fixes are for Memgraph's production deployments.

The exact cycle structure is visualized in the diagram below:

The team is also considering some form of Long-term Support (LTS) structure. If you have specific input about how we should organize around LTS, feel free to reach out or [open a new issue under this repo](https://github.com/memgraph/roadmap/issues) with the exact expectations.

## Daily Build of Memgraph and Mage 🏗️

Daily builds are useful for experimenting with recent improvements. Keep in mind these are not "official" releases and might not be suitable for running in production. But if you want to live on the edge, who are we to stop you from doing that 😂
