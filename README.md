## Release Cycle ‚ôªÔ∏è

Memgraph product team works in 6-week release cycles. Every six weeks, a new release of Memgraph includes all finished features and resolved bug reports. The exact release dates are visible as Due Dates under [milestones](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/milestones). There might be bug-fix releases between regular releases, depending on how critical these fixes are for Memgraph's production deployments.

The team is also considering some form of Long-term Support (LTS) structure. If you have specific input about how we should organize around LTS, feel free to reach out or [open a new issue under this repo](https://github.com/memgraph/roadmap/issues) with the exact expectations.
